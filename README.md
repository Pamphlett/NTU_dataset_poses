Please note that this is an ongoing project, any change could be possible utill the project is final.
### Description
This repo is created to share ground truth poses for lab members in ***CARTIN***, ***EEE***, NTU. These GT poses are acquired by registering each single scan against the GT point cloud map.

### :A side note:
* Although carfully checked, there could be some ill-estimated poses due to massive amount of data we are faced with. Please kindly open an issue, or contact me directly.
* If the pose of any specific data sequence is required, please also open an issue to indicate.
